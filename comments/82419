Hi,

We've been using Zendesk for the last little while, and have really  
grown to love the product.

We're ready to sign up, but we have a question about the pricing.   
We're a small startup that rotates support duty over the entire  
staff.  We've therefore created accounts for everyone -- even though  
there's really only one person answering support requests at any  
time.  Unfortunately, it looks like your pricing scheme isn't based  
around concurrent access, but instead is a simple count of the number  
of active users.

Is there any way to give us a discount or adjust the pricing with the  
understanding that even though we have 5 users, there is really only  
one user of the system active at once?

If not, are there any discounts available for small businesses (< 7  
people), or YCombinator startups?


Thanks,


Andrew

do these still go to you?
Hi Jill,

Are you still the Y combinator person?

Cheers,
Michael
Kate,

We used to give 6 month free trials on the Plus+ plan for all YCombinator trials; just wanted to run this by you before I offered this as an option.
