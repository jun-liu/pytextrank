Hi -

In one of the videos, it was mentioned that once a support ticket is closed,
it cannot be reopened.

Does this mean that we no longer have access?  or Can we easily review for
our records at a later date.

If we no longer have access, is there an alternative that you would suggest
as we need long-term histories
to be accessible.

Thank you.

Hi Jody

That means that you cant update the ticket or modify it but you have totally access to see it because closed tickets are all saved.
You can create a view under Manage > Views that list closed tickets

Hope this helps and if you have more questions please let us know

Best regards,

Love Your Zendesk
