I've started to invite some customers to try the site and give me feedback.

The first comment that came back:
"When I clicked the link from the email, the site came up with a request for setting the password. After entering the password, it took me to the site but I apparently was not logged in. After receiving your email, I took a look again to verify that I wasn't blind. There was no navigation bar but there was a small 'login' text in the upper right corner. "

Is there a way to make the "login" text larger.  It really is microscopic.

Thanks.

Alan
Hi Alan,

You can use a CSS widget to change the size of the text in the top right. Here is a example

#top-right, #top-right a {
font-size: 20px;
}

Just create a CSS widget in Account=>widgets add widget and paste the code in there. 

Cheers

Once I have the widget, how do I edit the Login page?



Thanks.


Alan

Hi Alan, 

Could you send me a screenshot of the page you are talking about highlighting the text you want bigger?

Thanks

The Login actually appears on the far right side (not sure why my screen
capture puts it on the extreme left). <http://www.evernote.com/> SwiftTest
